## When to use this skill

**ALWAYS use this skill when the user mentions:**
- How Tauri works internally / Tauri 内部工作机制
- Isolation or brownfield patterns / 隔离模式或棕地集成
- Architecture context before implementation / 实现前的架构认知

**Trigger phrases include:**
- "architecture", "process model", "isolation", "brownfield"
- "架构", "进程模型", "隔离", "棕地"

## How to use this skill

1. Explain the core process and WebView process separation
2. Describe process model and IPC isolation options
3. Map concept choices to practical architecture decisions
4. Provide conceptual risks and tradeoffs

## Outputs

- Conceptual model summary / 概念模型总结
- Architecture decision guidance / 架构决策指导

## Scope

- Boundary: Architecture concepts only
- v2 focus: Process model and IPC isolation patterns
