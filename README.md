**Tauri Skills** is an open-source collection of Agent Skills focused on **Tauri Cross-Platform Application Development**, strictly following the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/). It provides **51 professional skills** organized into **7 plugin categories** by functional area, covering the entire lifecycle of Tauri development from environment setup and application development to system integration, mobile adaptation, and security hardening.

With these skills, full-stack developers can leverage AI assistants like Claude to quickly master Tauri development best practices and efficiently build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications.

> **⚠️ Note:** This project is currently in Alpha stage and has not been rigorously tested. It is still under self-testing. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.

## What are Skills?

Skills are folders consisting of descriptions, scripts, and resources that Claude dynamically loads as needed to improve performance on specific tasks. Skills are used to teach Claude how to perform specific jobs in a reusable way, such as: initializing a Tauri project, configuring the system tray, handling file system operations, or integrating mobile features.
